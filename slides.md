## We live at uncertain times

![corona](/images/corona.jpeg)<!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Note:
- Many people lost their jobs and it is normal to be concerned about job security. We don’t know how the world after Coronavirus will look like. But we know that technology will be a part of it.

## Technology will be a part of the future

![corona](/images/tech-daily-life.png)<!-- .element  width="80%" -->

Note:
- Technology is deeply engraved into our lives. We depend on it for our daily activities, related to work leisure, social. Basic things like navigating with GMaps/TomTom, or booking a medical appointment through the internet, use technology with some degree of sophistication.

## Tech during COVID19
<small>

 <div class="row">
  <div class="column1">
    <li>Video calls with friends.
</li>
    <li>Online events</li>
    <li>Fitness classes.</li>
    <li>Stream movies and music.
</li>
    <li>News from various websites.
</li>
    <li>Order food through the Internet.</li>  
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
    <img src="/images/yoga_adriene.png" width="100%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;">
  </div>
</div> 


<table style="border-collapse: collapse; color:red; border: 0px yellow solid">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/images/spotify2.png" height="55px" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></td> 
        <td><img src="/images/netflix.jpeg" height="55px" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></td>
        <td><img src="/images/zoom.jpeg" height="55px" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

</small>

Note:
- With lockdown, we turn to the internet. To work, socializing, culture, fitness

## Remote working
<small>

 <div class="row">
  <div class="column1">
    <li>Distributed code development supported by tools such as Git.
</li>
    <li>Use of cloud servers, instead of physical infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Project management using tools such as Kanban boards, or issue tracking.
</li>
    <li>Different levels of communication through tools such a Slack, Gitter, Zoom or plain old email.
</li>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
    <img  style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" src="/images/computer_sillouette.gif" width="100%">
  </div>
</div> 
</small>

Note:
- We don’t know how social distancing will last. But for surem after the emergency state. The truth is technology work is already structured to be executed online.

## Why remote working rocks
<small>

 <div class="row">
  <div class="column1">
    <li>It gives you more freedom, to live where you like (and not necessarily in larger cities).
</li>
    <li>It gives you access to a wider range of job offers.
</li>
    <li>It removes commuting time.
</li>
    <li>It gives you access to the best breed of organic coffee :-)
</li>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
    <img  style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" src="/images/sup2.JPG" width="100%">
  </div>
</div> 
</small>

Note:
- Even after lockdown, there are reasons why you may want to do remote working. I was able to move from Rome to Barcelona, keeping my job, at the FAO, thanks to remote working. In 2016 I accepted an offer in a dutch company, without having to move there, thanks to remote working. About commuting time: Last year, I was taking 1 hour to commute to work everyday, in a combination of scooter + train + bike/walk. This amounts to 2 hours a day, and 10 hours a week (more than a working journey).

## There is more than one career option in Tech

- Employee
- Freelancer
- Entrepreneur
- Mix & match


<img  style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" src="/images/freelancer.gif" width="60%">

Note:
- Most people think about working for someone else, but there are other options available. Of course, you will need other skills, but tech skills are also important

## Why transitioning to a tech career?

1. Job resilience
* Flexibility
* Different “flavours” of autonomy

## How to transition to a tech career?

1. The “traditional” path.
* Self-learning.
* Bootcamps.


<img  style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" src="/images/journey.jpg" width="80%">

## Take a University Degree

<small>
- Choose from a diploma, a Master, etc.
- Takes a long time.
- If you already have a degree, there may be some overlap of knowledge/skills.
- More theoretical than hands-on.

<img  style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" src="/images/university.jpeg" width="40%">

<small>
Note:
- Strong foundation, but lack of market demanded skills.

---

## Learn by yourself

<small>
- Practical, hands-on approach (hacker)
- FOSS provide great learning grounds.
- Lots of first-class developers have followed this approach.
- It’s free
- It may take a really long time to learn.

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; color:red; border: 0px yellow solid">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/images/darlene.jpeg" height="200px" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></td> 
        <td><img src="/images/mrrobot.jpeg" height="200px" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<small>

Note:
- Learn by doing. Companies like Google or NR are starting to recognize this. It’s free, only if your time is worthless. Bedtime coders. It may take a really long time to learn: depending on your learning rate

---
## Bootcamps: the best of both worlds

<small>
- Guided, hands-on approach
- Fast pace, short time.
- Vocational training.
- Connection to job market

<img  style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" src="/images/bootcamp.jpeg" width="50%">

## CodeOp: Making Tech Accessible

![corona](/images/codeop_courses.png)

Note:
- Speak about theDevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) which aims to ship software in an efficient, fast and secure way

## Technology is Behind Everything

![corona](/images/data_domains.png)


---

![corona](/images/iot2.jpeg)

Note:
- Most people are using things,not building them. Computers will let you do anything: you just need a technical mind and being determinant. Basically, if you have a passion, you can bring this passion to tech. Tech is not one thing. It is one million things. If you want to participate in the dialogue that is going to shape our future, you need to be in tech

## Women are being left out of the discussion

![corona](/images/women_in_tech.png)

Note:
- We need women to be a force shaping the future of technology, and they’re simply not there. This numbers are from 2017 (the trend is only becoming worst)
Why is it so important to be part of this discussion?

## “Sorry, I cannot understand you!”

<small>
Early speech recognition machines were made by all-male teams, and they calibrated it for their voices.

</small>


Note:
- When they tried to sell to primarily female secretarial teams, the technology failed miserably.

---
## “Killer” Airbags

<small>
The team developing the early air-bags was all-male, and as they designed it, they used the height and weight chart for the standard man. The unintended and tragic consequence was that women and children were killed when those early airbags were deployed.

![corona](/images/killer_airbag.jpeg)
</small>


Note:
- Recently I was in a proposal review for the EC, and a team presented a project proposal for autonomous vehicles that did not take into account gender differences in driving behaviour in their training datasets. Diversity is incredible important, if innovations are going to impact all people.

## Our mission

Offer a specialized and diverse tech education, to the groups that have traditionally been on the margins of tech.

<img  style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" src="/images/empty_frame.png" width="50%">

Note:
- Empower them with skills to actively participate in shaping our society, and to create a more diverse and inclusive future for everyone.
